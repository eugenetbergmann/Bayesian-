Absolutely, that makes perfect sense! Here’s an updated description to incorporate these requirements:

Feature Title: API Data Normalization into PostgreSQL Table

Objective:
To automate the normalization of incoming API data from Plaid, QuickBooks, and HouseCall Pro, consolidating all data into a single, normalized transactions database. This database will support advanced matching algorithms using Bayesian processes, Monte Carlo search functions, and linear regressions while tracking the accuracy of matches to enable continuous retraining of the model.

Key Functional Requirements:
	1.	Normalize data from various APIs, including:
	•	Plaid (preprocessed via Rows.com): Check number, amount, date, memo line, and payer name.
	•	QuickBooks:
	•	Transactions from “Undeposited Funds,” including deposit number, transaction details, amount, and metadata fields.
	•	Invoice data, including invoice date, invoice amount, payer name, and a unique key ID.
	•	HouseCall Pro: Date, invoice number, invoice amount, payment data, and a unique key ID.
	2.	Consolidate all data into a single PostgreSQL table with a flexible schema to handle disparate fields. Missing fields (e.g., check number or invoice ID) should be included as null.
	3.	Assign a unique key to each record to ensure data traceability and prevent duplication.
	4.	Support matching algorithms based on Bayesian processes, Monte Carlo search functions, and linear regression models to determine correlations between transactions.
	5.	Track and log the accuracy of algorithmic matches to continuously retrain and improve the model.
	6.	Provide error handling to log and report any data anomalies or transformation failures.
	7.	Implement a modular approach to accommodate additional APIs or data sources in the future.

Unique Key Design:
	•	For Plaid (via Rows.com preprocessing), the unique key could combine check_number + date + amount.
	•	For QuickBooks transactions, the unique key could combine deposit_number + transaction_date + amount.
	•	For QuickBooks invoices, the unique key will use the unique_key_id provided by QuickBooks.
	•	For HouseCall Pro, the unique key will use the unique_key_id provided by the API.

Database Design Considerations:
	•	Create a normalized structure with a primary transactions table that can store all fields (with null values for missing data).
	•	Include auxiliary tables or columns for tracking the accuracy of matches and retraining metrics.

Benefits:
	•	Centralized and standardized data repository for all API transactions and invoices.
	•	Robust matching capabilities using advanced algorithms to improve correlation and reconciliation accuracy.
	•	Tracking and improving the matching model through retraining based on logged accuracy metrics.
	•	Scalable architecture to support additional data sources as needed.
