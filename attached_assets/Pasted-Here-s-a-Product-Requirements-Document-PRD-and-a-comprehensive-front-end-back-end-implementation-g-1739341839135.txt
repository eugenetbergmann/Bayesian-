Here’s a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and a comprehensive front-end/back-end implementation guide for the dashboard and the automated matching system.

Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Product Overview

The goal is to develop a system that starts as a human-supervised dashboard for matching checks, invoices, and deposits. Over time, the system transitions into an automated process by integrating feedback to refine its model.

2. Features

Phase 1: Human-Supervised Dashboard
	•	Match Suggestions:
	•	Display checks, invoices, and deposits with confidence scores.
	•	Highlight discrepancies (amount, date, memo).
	•	User Actions:
	•	Confirm matches.
	•	Reject or override matches.
	•	Provide feedback (reason for rejection).
	•	Analytics:
	•	Metrics on confirmed/rejected matches.
	•	Model performance (precision, recall, confidence threshold).

Phase 2: Semi-Automated Matching
	•	Automate matches above a predefined confidence threshold.
	•	Route ambiguous matches to the dashboard.

Phase 3: Fully Automated Matching
	•	Automate all matching processes.
	•	Retain periodic human review for performance monitoring.
	•	Include fallback mechanisms for unresolvable cases.

3. Functional Requirements

Dashboard Features
	1.	Data Display:
	•	List checks, invoices, and deposits.
	•	Show calculated confidence scores and feature details.
	2.	Actions:
	•	Confirm, reject, or edit matches.
	•	Log reasons for manual changes.
	3.	Feedback Storage:
	•	Store confirmed/rejected matches and feedback for retraining the model.

Backend
	•	Data Normalization:
	•	Convert check, invoice, and deposit data into a unified format.
	•	Monte Carlo Matching:
	•	Generate potential bundles and calculate likelihood scores.
	•	Bayesian Prediction:
	•	Update priors based on feedback to improve future matches.
	•	Threshold-Based Automation:
	•	Automatically match items above a confidence threshold.

Database
	•	Store:
	•	Checks, invoices, and deposits.
	•	Suggested matches and their confidence scores.
	•	User feedback and corrections.
	•	Model performance metrics.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Performance: The dashboard should handle up to 10,000 records without latency issues.
	•	Scalability: Backend should support additional data sources as the business grows.
	•	Security:
	•	Ensure data encryption for sensitive financial information.
	•	Implement role-based access control for dashboard users.

5. Success Metrics
	•	Accuracy: >95% for automated matches after Phase 3.
	•	Feedback: >80% of human-reviewed matches align with initial predictions by Phase 2.
	•	Efficiency: Reduce manual matching time by 80% within 6 months of implementation.

Front-End/Back-End Guide

Front-End Implementation

Framework
	•	Use React.js or Streamlit for a dynamic and interactive user interface.

Components
	1.	Dashboard View:
	•	Table View:
	•	Display matches (checks, invoices, deposits) with key details:
	•	Amount differences, date differences, memo matches.
	•	Highlight discrepancies.
	•	Match Details Panel:
	•	Provide expanded details for a selected match (e.g., all features contributing to the confidence score).
	2.	User Actions:
	•	Buttons for:
	•	Confirm: Mark a match as correct.
	•	Reject: Mark a match as incorrect and provide feedback.
	•	A feedback form (optional).
	3.	Analytics Dashboard:
	•	Display:
	•	Total matches confirmed/rejected.
	•	Model performance (precision, recall, etc.).
	•	Graphs showing match confidence distribution.

Example React Component

import React, { useState } from "react";

function MatchDashboard({ matches }) {
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState({});

  const handleConfirm = (id) => {
    console.log(`Match ${id} confirmed`);
    // Send confirmation to backend
  };

  const handleReject = (id, reason) => {
    console.log(`Match ${id} rejected with reason: ${reason}`);
    // Send rejection feedback to backend
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Invoice Matching Dashboard</h1>
      {matches.map((match) => (
        <div key={match.id}>
          <h3>Match ID: {match.id}</h3>
          <p>Confidence: {match.confidence}%</p>
          <p>Amount Difference: ${match.amount_diff}</p>
          <p>Date Difference: {match.date_diff} days</p>
          <button onClick={() => handleConfirm(match.id)}>Confirm</button>
          <button
            onClick={() => handleReject(match.id, feedback[match.id] || "No reason provided")}
          >
            Reject
          </button>
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="Provide feedback"
            onChange={(e) =>
              setFeedback({ ...feedback, [match.id]: e.target.value })
            }
          />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MatchDashboard;

Back-End Implementation

Framework
	•	Use FastAPI (Python) for API development and PostgreSQL for data storage.

Endpoints
	1.	GET /matches:
	•	Fetch check-invoice-deposit matches and their confidence scores.
	•	Include details like amount differences, date differences, and memo matches.
	2.	POST /confirm_match:
	•	Accept a match ID and mark it as confirmed.
	3.	POST /reject_match:
	•	Accept a match ID and rejection reason.
	•	Store feedback for model retraining.
	4.	GET /analytics:
	•	Return match performance metrics for the analytics dashboard.

Example API

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

# Simulated Data
matches = [
    {"id": 1, "amount_diff": 0.01, "date_diff": 2, "confidence": 98},
    {"id": 2, "amount_diff": 0.50, "date_diff": 5, "confidence": 85},
]

# Models
class Feedback(BaseModel):
    match_id: int
    reason: str

@app.get("/matches")
def get_matches():
    return matches

@app.post("/confirm_match")
def confirm_match(match_id: int):
    return {"status": "Match confirmed", "match_id": match_id}

@app.post("/reject_match")
def reject_match(feedback: Feedback):
    return {"status": "Match rejected", "match_id": feedback.match_id, "reason": feedback.reason}

Database Design

Table Name	Columns
matches	id, check_id, invoice_id, confidence, amount_diff, date_diff
feedback	id, match_id, action (confirm/reject), reason, timestamp
analytics	id, metric_name, value, timestamp

Pipeline for Model Feedback
	1.	Data Ingestion:
	•	Collect human feedback (confirmed/rejected matches).
	•	Update the Bayesian priors using the new feedback data.
	2.	Model Retraining:
	•	Retrain the regression and Bayesian models periodically with feedback.
	•	Evaluate performance and adjust the confidence threshold.
	3.	Deployment:
	•	Integrate retrained models into the backend.

Deployment
	•	Frontend: Host on Vercel or Netlify.
	•	Backend: Deploy via AWS Lambda or Heroku.
	•	Database: Use PostgreSQL on AWS RDS or Supabase.
